/** Scale a value from one range to another

 * Example of use:
 *
 * Convert 33 from a 0-100 range to a 0-65535 range
 * var n = scaleValue(33, [0,100], [0,65535]);
 *
 * Ranges don't have to be positive
 * var n = scaleValue(0, [-50,+50], [0,65535]);
 *
 * Ranges are defined as arrays of two values, inclusive
